# Shitzu the Weather-Bot

**Main Idea :** create a serverless Interactive Weather Bot(using as many python libraries as needed :P)  

For the listening(speech-to-text) & Speaking ability(Text-to-Speech), I made use of speech_recognition, gTTS(library) in python. Thank you Google. :)

The bot will ping the open-source Weather api : https://www.metaweather.com/ to aquire the weather status. 

It speaks out the weather status in the structure that is hardcoded. 


It is written in a Macbook air.
