# Shitzu the Weather-Bot

**Main Idea :** <br>
To create a serverless Interactive Weather Bot(using as many python libraries as needed :P)  

**How to use**<br>
Ask for weather status of a single city for a single date. 

**Modules used**<br>
For the listening(speech-to-text) & Speaking ability(Text-to-Speech), I made use of speech_recognition, gTTS(library) in python. Thank you Google. :)

The bot will ping the open-source Weather api : https://www.metaweather.com/ to aquire the weather status. 

I used a pretrained spacy library for entity recognition. 

Thank you timefhuman - package(Python Library) for converting my date entities to numbers!

It speaks out the weather status in a structure that is hardcoded. 

It is written in a Macbook air.
